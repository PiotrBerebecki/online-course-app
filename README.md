# Online Course Management App
---

Live version can be seen on [Heroku](Link coming soon). The app sleeps on a free server so you may need to wait a couple of seconds for it to wake up.

The app has been developed by Piotr Berebecki as part of undertaking an excellent Pluralsight course: [Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6) by Cory House.

The technologies used include:

* React
* ES6
* Node
* Webpack
* Express
* Mocha (testing framework)
* Expect (assertion library)
* Enzyme (testing helper library)
* Foundation (front-end framework)
* Redux thunk (async library)
* Mock API
* Git
* GitHub
* Heroku
